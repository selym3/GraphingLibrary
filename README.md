# Graphing Library

A simple graphing for continuous input streams

## Features

* Abstractions to handle SDL initialization (not well supported) and user input
* Graph data class to represent data

## TODO

* Add filtered graph datas
* Be able to create references to graph datas that you are passing into the graph
* More secure SDL code & the pan and zooming needs work
